# No sound after waking from sleep
This happens on my M2 MacBookPro 16", the headphone no sound after waking from sleep.
The reason remains unknown, but a reboot or the following will work for me
```sh
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

# tree commandline to display file structure
```sh
brew install tree
```

# Display DDC for external monitors
